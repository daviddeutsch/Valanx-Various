Copy somewhere near your base software directory and mod the files to match your paths.

This will do three things when you run it:

0. Walk through your entire project and locate language files and code

Language files will be converted and code will be updated

1. Convert define() based .php language files into standard .ini files

Based on a root language file, this will put out picture perfect clones - but only the stuff that you actually did translate.

2. Replace all constants in the entire codebase with their JText::_() counterpart that we just created

And that's cool, dude.
